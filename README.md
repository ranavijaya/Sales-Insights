## Problem Statement

India-based **AtliQ** Hardware is a supplier of computer hardware and peripherals to the entire country of India. They have numerous stores all around India, including Nomad stores and surge stores. Delhi is where the company's headquarters are located.

The company's sales manager has a lot of obstacles to overcome. In a market that is expanding quickly, he is having trouble tracking sales. He is having problems with his company's insights

To accomplish this, he has some of the company's regional managers in North, South, and Central India. He phones them and inquiries about the insights he is interested in. They inform him of the growth and sales for the previous quarter. Therefore, the verbal nature of the talks that are taking place is the problem.

As a result, the regional managers are sugarcoating the information, and the corporate manager does not have a complete understanding of the information.

He is unable to act even after realizing that sales are falling off since he lacks a clear picture of the situation. When he requests the records, the regional manager gives him excel files. But he can't make sense of little things this way.

The management only needs an overview of the area where the business needs to make improvements to boost sales. He seeks understanding that is digestible, clear, and uncomplicated. Because data tells the truth, he is more interested in a dashboard where he can access the true data. All he needs is a straightforward data visualization tool that he can use every day.

Therefore, adopting such tools and technology allows one to make data-driven decisions that aid in boosting the company's sales. Therefore, in this project, we'll assist a business in creating its own PowerBI sales dashboard. So, in this project will help a company make its own sales related dashboard using PowerBI.

## Data Discovery

Planning a project utilizing the AIMS grid

There are four parts to the project management tool known as AIMS grid.

1) Objective (what to do exactly)

2) Holders that stack (who will be involved)

3) The outcome (what do you want to achieve)

4) Success standards (cost optimization and time save)

In our scenario, the dashboard will be produced as the final product, and the success criteria will be increasing sales through cost optimization while saving the manager of the business time.

## Data Analysis Using SQL

Step 1: Importing Data to MySQL workbench

Step 2: Simple analysis of data by looking into different tables and reflecting garbage values

Step 3: Primary analysis of data base by running different SQL statements

##

## Data Cleaning & ETL

Step 1: We are going to connect MySQL with the PowerBI desktop

Step 2: Loading the data into the PowerBI desktop

Step 3: Transforming data with the help of Power Query

## Dashboard/Insights

Key insights that can be generated from our dashboard are listed below

1- **Revenue contribution by market** which implies how much a particular state has contributed to the revenue generation out of the total revenue. For example, Delhi ncr has total contribution of 54.7% in the revenue generation.

2- **Top 5 products in the market** along with there percentage contribution in the revenue is an informative insight for example Prod 318 has revenue generation of 8.79M which is 25.83% of the total market revenue.

3- **Tracking the revenue** trends helps us to find the insights about how the company is performing in terms of revenue generation from last year

4 **- Revenue contribution by market zone** helps us to track which zone is performing the best in terms of revenue contribution for example from the insights North zone contributed only 0.9 % in the generating revenue.

5- **Tracking sales Qty by markets** -This tabular representation covering the detail representation of revenue, revenue contribution %, profit margin contribution and profit margin % helps the company owner to eliminate the business which are unprofitable. For example, the "ElectricalSaraStores" holds the profit margin contribution of 11.9% and the dealer has 0.4 % profit margin. This is quite profitable deal to the company as the return margin contribution is high. For the case of "electricquipo" the profit margin is negative 11.5% and the contribution is -0.5% which is not a profitable deal.

This helps the company to eliminate the non-profitable customers

6 - **Year options** in the dashboard provides the flexibility to track figures for the year /month.

7- Detailed analyses of the total revenue generated sales quantity and total profit margin is also build in the dashboard.
